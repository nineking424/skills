# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Common mistakes when enhancing prompts that should be avoided.

## Enhancement Anti-Patterns

### 1. Over-Engineering
- Adding unnecessary complexity
- Suggesting features not requested
- Over-specifying implementation details

### 2. Assumption Without Validation
- Assuming technology stack without checking
- Guessing architectural patterns
- Making NFR assumptions without context

### 3. Ignoring Existing Patterns
- Not analyzing current codebase conventions
- Proposing conflicting architectural styles
- Missing existing utility/helper classes

### 4. Incomplete Context Gathering
- Skipping infrastructure analysis
- Missing error handling patterns
- Ignoring testing conventions

## Best Practices

1. Always analyze before enhancing
2. Ask clarifying questions when uncertain
3. Present enhanced requirements for confirmation
4. Reference existing patterns in the codebase
